In 2006 I graduated from Brigham Young University with a BA in Communications.  After graduating, I started work with eBay as a Top Seller Account Manager and since then I have worked at Overstock.com, Amazon and now I’m currently working for Adobe.  While a lot of my professional career was spent in account management I was also a data analyst.  In my current role, I launch A/B tests and report on the findings to our marketing team.

Programming Background
For two years in high school I took a Visual Basic computer class.  That was over 15 years ago now and was the last formal training I’ve had.  In my jobs I have dabbled in SQL, HTML and Javascript though I only know enough to be dangerous.
